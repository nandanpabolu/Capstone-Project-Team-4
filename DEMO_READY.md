## üß™ Live Testing During Demo

If you want to show it's real-time:

### Test 1: Different Invention
```
A wearable device that monitors vital signs and predicts medical emergencies 
using machine learning. The device includes ECG sensors, blood oxygen monitors, 
and accelerometers. It can detect irregular heartbeats, predict seizures, and 
automatically alert emergency services with the user's location.
```

### Test 2: Modify Generation Options
- Change temperature from 0.7 to 0.9 (more creative)
- Change max tokens to show different lengths
- Show how it affects output

### Test 3: API Test
1. Open http://localhost:8000/docs
2. Try `/health` endpoint - shows status
3. Try `/generate/memo` with sample JSON
4. Show response time and structure

---

## üö® Troubleshooting (Just in Case)

### If API won't start:
```bash
pkill -f uvicorn
cd ~/Desktop/Full_Time/Projects/Project_Experiment/Capstone
source venv/bin/activate
make api
```

### If UI won't start:
```bash
pkill -f streamlit
make ui
```

### If Ollama not responding:
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
ollama list

# If not, start it
ollama serve &

# Test generation
ollama run mistral:latest "Hello"
```

### If generation fails:
- Check logs in terminal
- Verify Mistral model: `ollama list`
- Check API health: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`

## üí¨ Sample Q&A

**Q: How long does generation take?**  
A: 87-90 seconds per document. We're using a 7B parameter model running locally. Cloud APIs would be faster but violate privacy requirements.

**Q: Can it handle real patents?**  
A: Yes! Sprint 2 will add USPTO patent ingestion and search. The generation already works - we just need the prior art data.

**Q: What about accuracy?**  
A: The output is USPTO-compliant in format. Content accuracy depends on the LLM and prior art context. Lawyers always review and edit - this is an assistant, not a replacement.

**Q: How much does it cost?**  
A: $0/month. Everything is open-source. Only cost is hardware (any modern laptop works).

**Q: Is it really offline?**  
A: Yes! We have an OFFLINE=true environment flag. No external API calls. All processing local.

**Q: Can other teams use this?**  
A: Absolutely! It's on GitHub with MIT license. Well documented and ready for collaboration.
