## ❓ **Q&A Prep**

**Q: "How is this different from Google Patents?"**
> A: We're AI-powered with citation tracking, completely offline for privacy, and free. Google Patents is just search.

**Q: "Why not use ChatGPT?"**
> A: Privacy concerns - law firms can't send client data to OpenAI. We run everything locally.

**Q: "When will it be ready?"**
> A: MVP end of Sprint 2 (5 weeks). Production-ready by final demo.

**Q: "Can it replace patent attorneys?"**
> A: No - it's an **assistant**, not a replacement. Lawyers verify all outputs.

**Q: "What about patent law compliance?"**
> A: We provide tools, lawyers ensure compliance. Our citation tracking helps maintain accountability.
